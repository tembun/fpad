This is my patched trully lightweight (~407KB stripped) FeatherPad,
which itself is a v0.16 (https://github.com/tsujan/FeatherPad/tree/V0.16.0)
fork of this editor, but without most of its fancy bloat and unneeded features.

As the result, it has only dark theme mode, a couple of basic options
and preferences and that's it. The fucking simple visual text editor,
not actually FeatherPad.

Here you can move the cursor both with your mouse if you wish and
with keys `j' (left), `k' (up), `;' (right) and `l' (down), while
the `Alt' key is pressed.

It also adds some features that the original editor lacks.
For example:
	- syncing the cursor whilst scrolling.
	- a list of shortcuts for searching.
	- a vertical 80-characters long ruler.
	- a shortcut (`Alt + 1' for triggering the `jump-to-line'.
	- solid block non-blinking cursor.
	- shortcuts for text navigation:
		- `Ctrl + Alt + j' -- select left to the start of line.
		- `Ctrl + Alt + ;' -- select right to the end of line.
		- `PgUp', `PgDn' -- scroll 9 lines up/down.
		- `Ctrl + PgUp', `Ctrl + PgDn' -- go to the start/end of a file.
and some other stuff I don't event remember, you'd better look into `git log'.

All the information you need about building & installing it, you can find
in the INSTALL.* files:
	INSTALL.freebsd -- instructions for FreeBSD specifically.
	INSTALL.other -- instructions for other platforms.
